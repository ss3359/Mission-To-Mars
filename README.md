# Mission-To-Mars

# Overview
This is an introduction on making a website that scrapes well known data between planets of the Solar System. In particular we look the differences in data between the planets Earth and Mars. For finishing touches, we have customized the webpage to include a colorized scrape data button along with customizing the images of Mars' hemispheres. 

# Summary 
First, we have used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrpape full resolution images of Mars' hemispheres and their respective titles. BeautifulSoup is a python package for parsing HTML documents and extracting data from them as well. Splinter is an open source tool to test web applications using Python. 

The next portion was using our Python and HTML programming to add code we created when extracting the images of Mars' hemispheres and making a HTML file so the webpage contains all of the information we collected about Mars, including the resolution images and titles for each hemisphere image. 

The last part is to add some final touches to our webpage. We have updated the webpage so it is mobile-responsive and added two Bootstrap 3 components to make our webpage stand out.
